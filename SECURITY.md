# Security

## Reporting a bug in Next.js project template

Report security bugs in the Next.js template via [The Maintainer's Email][].

Your report will be acknowledged within 5 days, and you'll receive a more
detailed response to your report within 10 days indicating the next steps in
handling your submission.

After the initial reply to your report, you will be kept informed of the progress
being made towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information
or guidance surrounding the reported issue.

## Reporting a bug in a third party module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective
maintainers.

## Disclosure policy

Here is the security disclosure policy for the Next.js Project Template:

- The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This
  person will coordinate the fix and release process. The problem is confirmed
  and a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find
  any potential similar problems. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are
  still under maintenance. These fixes are not committed to the public
  repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.

- A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen.

- Typically the embargo date will be set 72 hours after the vulnerability is
  discovered. However, this may vary depending on the severity of the bug or
  difficulty in applying a fix.

- This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required
  with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the
  bug in as timely a manner as possible; however, it's important that we follow
  the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a
  consistent manner.

## Comments on this policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
[pull request](https://github.com/rikhall1515/nextjs-project-template) or

## Asking for general help

If you need help with the project setup for this next.js template, feel free
to direct your questions towards the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/rikhall1515/nextjs-project-template/discussions).

## Submitting a bug report

When you find a bug in this project, open up an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rikhall1515/nextjs-project-template/issues).
The two most important pieces of information we need in order to properly
evaluate the report is a description of the behavior you are seeing and a simple
test case we can use to recreate the problem on our own. If we cannot recreate
the issue, it becomes impossible for us to fix.

See [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

## Triaging a bug report

Once an issue has been opened, it is common for there to be discussion
around it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue,
including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This discussion
is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.
